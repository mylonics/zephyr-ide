## Requirements

In order for this application to work correctly the zephyr require build tools need to be installed and available on the path. These include cmake, python3, and Devicetree Compiler. 

See the [Install Dependecies Section of the Zephyr Getting Started Guide](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/develop/getting_started/index.html#install-dependencies)

For ubuntu please also install python3-venv by ```sudo apt install python3-venv```

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `zephyr-ide.projects`: Project structure to manually edit or share with other.
* `zephyr-ide.use-zephyr-ide-json`: Allows the use of a separate .json file. Useful if settings.json has unrelated local settings that should not be shared.

## Known Issues

* macOS compatibility is untested. Please make an issue on our github page with any incompatibilities found.
