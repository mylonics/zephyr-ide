# Setup Panel

When you first open a workspace in VS Code with Zephyr IDE installed, you can access the Setup Panel through:

- The Zephyr IDE sidebar activity bar icon
- Command Palette: `Zephyr IDE: Setup Workspace`
- The Extension Setup View panel

The Setup Panel is the central hub for configuring your Zephyr development environment. It provides a card-based interface with three main areas.

## Setup Panel Overview

The Setup Panel presents three configuration cards:

1. **Host Tools** - Install and verify build tools required for Zephyr development
2. **Zephyr SDK Management** - Install and manage Zephyr SDK for different architectures
3. **Workspace** - Configure west workspace and Zephyr project dependencies

Click on any card to access detailed configuration options for that component.
