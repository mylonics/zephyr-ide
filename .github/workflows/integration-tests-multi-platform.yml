# Multi-Platform Integration Tests Pipeline
#
# This workflow runs integration tests on multiple platforms (Windows, Ubuntu, macOS).
# It uses a single-process approach where all installation and test steps run
# sequentially in the same VS Code instance, solving Windows PATH propagation issues.
#
# Architecture:
# 1. Stage 1: Build VSIX on Ubuntu
# 2. Stage 2: Three parallel platform jobs that:
#    - Install VS Code
#    - Install the VSIX extension
#    - Run a single combined test that sequentially:
#      a) Installs package manager (winget/apt/brew)
#      b) Installs host packages (cmake, ninja, gperf, etc.)
#      c) Runs workspace tests
#    - All steps execute in the SAME process, so PATH refresh works immediately
#
# Benefits:
# - PATH updates propagate within same process
# - refreshWindowsPath() makes tools immediately visible on Windows
# - No cross-process PATH issues
# - Cleaner architecture with single test execution
