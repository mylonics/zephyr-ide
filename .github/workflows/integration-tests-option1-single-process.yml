# Multi-Platform Integration Tests - Option 1: Single Process
# 
# This workflow implements Option 1 to solve Windows PATH propagation:
# All 3 steps (install package manager, install packages, run tests) execute
# sequentially in the SAME VS Code instance/process.
#
# Benefits:
# - PATH updates propagate within same process
# - refreshWindowsPath() makes tools immediately visible
# - No cross-process PATH issues
#
# Architecture:
# 1. Stage 1: Build VSIX on Ubuntu
# 2. Stage 2: Three parallel platform jobs that run a SINGLE combined test:
#    - Install VS Code
#    - Install the VSIX extension
#    - Run combined test that sequentially calls:
#      a) install-package-manager-headless command
#      b) install-host-packages-headless command (PATH refresh happens here)
#      c) workspace tests (tools now visible in same process)
